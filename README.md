🦸‍♂️ Superhero Data Analysis!

📊 From Database to Charts

Calling all superhero fans! 🔥
I worked on a superhero database to uncover fascinating trends.
Let's see what insights we can extract!


🔍 Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation

First, I connected to SQLite and loaded the superhero table.
Since there were many unnecessary columns, I removed:

❌ id – Not needed

❌ first_appearance – Reformatted to show only the year

Then, I removed duplicates and filled missing values to clean the dataset. ✨
I also formatted superhero names to improve readability.


📊 Data Analysis & Visualization

1️⃣ Superhero Eye Colors 👀

A bar chart showed the most common eye colors among superheroes.

2️⃣ Superhero Hair Colors 💇‍♂️

A pie chart visualized the distribution of hair colors.

3️⃣ Number of Superheroes Introduced Each Year 📅

A line plot tracked the number of new superheroes introduced over time.

4️⃣ First Appearance vs. Appearances Count 🔄

Do older superheroes appear in more stories?
I used a scatter plot to explore this relationship.

5️⃣ Distribution of Character Appearances 📖

A histogram displayed how frequently superheroes appeared in different stories.

6️⃣ Eye Color vs. Appearances Counts 🤨

A box plot examined whether eye color impacts the number of story appearances.
